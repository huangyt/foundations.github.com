PDFlib - A library for generating PDF on the fly
================================================

Portable library for dynamically generating PDF documents with support
for many other programming languages and development environments.

PDFlib distribution packages for many platforms are available from
www.pdflib.com.

PDFlib is a library for generating PDF files. It offers an API with
support for text, vector graphics, raster images, and hypertext. Call PDFlib
routines from within your client program and voila: dynamic PDF files!

PDFlib is available on a wide variety of operating system platforms,
and supports many programming languages and development environments:

- C
- C++
- Cobol
- COM (Visual Basic, ASP, Windows Script Host, Delphi, and many others)
- Java via the JNI, including servlets and JSP
- .NET framework (VB.NET, ASP.NET, C# and others).
- Objective-C
- Perl
- PHP
- Python
- REALbasic
- RPG
- Ruby
- Tcl

An overview of PDFlib features can be found in the PDFlib Tutorial and
the PDFlib API Reference. Separate Windows editions of these manuals
cover the COM, .NET, and REALbasic bindings.


PDFlib flavors
==============
The PDFlib product family includes the following products (see the PDFlib
tutorial for a detailed comparison):

- PDFlib includes a variety of functions for generating PDF output.

- PDFlib+PDI includes all PDFlib functions, plus the PDF Import Library (PDI)
  for including existing PDF pages in the generated output. It also includes
  the pCOS interface for querying PDF objects.

- PDFlib Personalization Server (PPS) includes PDFlib+PDI plus functions for
  automatically filling PDFlib Blocks. A PPS license also covers the
  PDFlib Block Plugin for creating Blocks interactively with Adobe Acrobat
  on Mac and Windows.


Binary Packages
===============
PDFlib, PDFlib+PDI, and PPS are available in binary form, and require
a commercial license. All of these products are available in a single
combined library, and can be evaluated without a commercial license. However,
unless a valid license key is applied a demo stamp will be generated
across all pages, and the pCOS facility (included in PDFlib+PDI and PPS)
is restricted to small input documents.

Instructions for using the binary packages for various platforms and
language bindings can be found in the document readme-binary.txt.
