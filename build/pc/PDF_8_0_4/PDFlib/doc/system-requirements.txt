System Requirements for PDFlib GmbH Products
============================================

This document describes the requirements for using PDFlib GmbH binaries on
various platforms. This list covers all platforms on which at least one
product is supported. It should not be construed as a commitment regarding
the availability of product/platform combinations.

To find out whether a PDFlib GmbH product is supported at all on a particular
platform please check the downloadable binary packages which are available
at www.pdflib.com.


================================
Note on 64-bit Intel platforms
================================
Intel uses the term "Intel 64" for a processor architecture which is
known by several other names:
- Intel formerly called it EM64T (after using IA-32e)
- Microsoft and Sun call it x64
- AMD calls it AMD64 (after using x86-64)
- Linux systems often refer to x86_64

PDFlib GmbH binaries for Intel 64 work on all architectures listed above.
They do not work on Intel Itanium (formerly called IA-64), which is
a separate architecture.
Because of the vendor-specific conventions we continue to use the term "x64"
instead of "Intel 64" in the context of Sun and Microsoft operating systems. 


================================
Windows
================================

Requirements:
Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7 on x86 or x64
Windows Server 2003/2003 R2/2008/2008 R2 on x86 or x64

.NET binding
------------
The following flavors are supported:
- .NET Framework 2.0 - 3.5
- .NET Framework 4.0
- 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions of the above

See PDFlib-in-.NET-HowTo.pdf for details on .NET configuration.

With ASP.NET 2.0 the .NET editions of PDFlib GmbH products require
Full Trust level. They do not work with any other trust level, such as
High or Medium Trust.

C and C++ bindings

Project files for the programming samples are available for
Visual Studio 2005. VS2008 and VS2010 can convert these automatically.
