 *
 * <p>This was the main event-handling interface for SAX1; in
 * SAX2, it has been replaced by {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler
 * ContentHandler}, which provides Namespace support and reporting
 * of skipped entities.  This interface is included in SAX2 only
 * to support legacy SAX1 applications.</p>
 *
 * <p>The order of events in this interface is very important, and
 * mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For
 * example, all of an element's content (character data, processing
 * instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between
 * the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.</p>
 *
 * <p>Application writers who do not want to implement the entire
 * interface can derive a class from HandlerBase, which implements
 * the default functionality; parser writers can instantiate
 * HandlerBase to obtain a default handler.  The application can find
 * the location of any document event using the Locator interface
 * supplied by the Parser through the setDocumentLocator method.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
 *             {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler}
 *             interface, which includes Namespace support.
 * @since SAX 1.0
