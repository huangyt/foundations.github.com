ACDK Core (acdk_core)
</title>


<shortdescription>
acdk_core contains the core distribution of ACDK.
</shortdescription>

<description>
The ACDK Core package contains the basic tools and libraries of the ACDK framework.

The <m>acdk_core</m> library includes the basic classes in the namespaces %nsref[acdk::lang], 
%nsref[acdk::util], %nsref[acdk::io], %nsref[acdk::lang::reflect],
and %nsref[acdk::lang::ref] (corresponds to java.lang, java.io, java.util, etc.)
and establish a %ref[powerfull and simple framework, acdk_hb_lang], with most %ref[features, acdk_about_features] 
known by Java or C#.

<m>acdk_core</m> also implements the basic %ref[reflection, acdk_hb_mi], late binding and 
%ref[object oriented integration of scripting languages, acdk_hb_dmi].

Additionally <m>acdk_core</m> contains a %ref[logging framework, acdk_util_logging] similar
to frameworks like log4j.

The Metacompiler %ref[<m>acdkmc</m>, acdkmc_man] add %ref[Metainfo, acdk_hb_mi] 
like runtime type information, support for %ref[ClassLoader, acdk_hb_mi_nameservice]
and attached %ref[Attributes, acdk_hb_mi_attributes] to C++.

Because software quality is direcly connected to the availability of a testing framework
the %ref[unit test framework, acdk_tools_aunit_man]  <m>acdk_tools_aunit</m> is included
in the ACDK Core package.

The library %ref[<m>acdk_security</m>, acdk_security_man] contains some basic encryption functions.

The scripting language %ref[CfgScript, acdk_cfgscript_hb] is a %ref[full featured, acdk_cfgscript_hb_intro] 
object oriented scripting language with Java/ACDK syntax, which does not only allow to instrument all ACDK
classes in scripts, but also define own ACDK classes.

Detailed documentation about ACDK, with %ref[handbook, acdk_hb] and %ref[API reference, acdk_reference] is available online
or for %ref[download, http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15364&package_id=12244].

===========================================================
4.14.0
- all: boost performance for most platforms and compilers:
  - using compiler build in static thread local if possible
    If acdk_core.dll/so itself is not static linked to the 
    the executable still use pthread/Win32 thread local
  - with the -acdk-sp command line option for single CPU machines
    atomic operations (int++) will not be synchronized.
  - acdk::lang::String caches the calculated hashCode, which
    is great performance improvement if intensivelly used
    HashMaps with String as keys.
    String::equals first check if hashCodes of two Strings
    are identical.
    with the ASCLITERAL/StaticAsciiLiteral literals can be 
    defined static with precalculated hashCode, which 
    boosts the equals method.
- Thread::suspend(), and Thread::stop() implemented.
  The suspend or stop a thread it has to be in a
  waitable status (Object::wait(), Thread::sleep(), 
  Thread::join(), Process::waitFor()).
- Thread::terminate() implemented. This method 'kills' 
  a thread immediatelly and does no cleanup or releasing
  locks.
- Implemented Process::suspend() and Process::resume.
- Add unicode encoding with and without C-Escapes (AsciiUtf and
  AsciiCEscUtf).
- String: fixed memory leak in normalize().
- add acdk::lang::sys::core_memtrace to trace memory leaks
  and / or to profile memory usage.
- MS compiler: if C structured exceptions are available
  the -> operator on Reference Objects (like o->toString())
  does not longer check for NullPointer, but uses the C exceptions
  to detect null pointers and throw NullPointerException. 
- acdk::lang::String: Add various convenience methods inspired
	from the Java apache package StringUtils, like defaultString,
	isEmpty, isNotEmpty, isBlank, isAlpha, isAlphaSpace, contains,
	containsNone, containsOnly, indexOfAny, lastIndexOfAny, join,
	split, deleteWhitespace, repeat, rightPad, leftPad, center, 
	indexOfDifference, getDifference.
- Unicode characters > 0x0237 where misinterpreted. The new
	unicode character table should be fixed now.
- Locales are for ~ 130 languages/countries are available.
	The Locale settings for various localized names and formats
	are now defined in properties (acdk_core/cfg/acdk/locale).
- if class static RObject create_instance() defines, it does not 
	need extended metainfo to use Class::forName()->newInstance().
- The default Locale and encoding is initialized from the underlying
	operation system.
	Add Locale::setSystemLocale() family in case of using/synchronizing 
	c library calls.
- acdk_tools_aunit: add %cref[acdk::tools::aunit::CfgScriptTestCase] 
  and %cref[acdk::tools::aunit::CfgScriptTestSuite] for integrating
  CfgScripts as unit tests.
- All: parse -Dkey=value options for setting system
  properties values.
- acdk::util::RessourceBundle: fixed various bugs.
- acdk::util::Properties: fixed various bugs loading/storing
  properties from/to file.
- acdk::util::Properties: add eval() method to replace $(KEY)
  expression with properties value.
- map common runtime configuration options in System::properties.
	Please refer also to acdk_core/cfg/acdk.cfg for available
	values.
- All: deleted or replaced LATIN1 characters in code
- All: Supports Visual Studio 2005 Express Beta.
- All: Remove senseless warnings in Visual Studio while preprocessing
  for dependencies.
- Unix platforms: fixed Object::wait(ms) with ms > 0 on some unix
  platforms (linux). 
- Throwable can have a nested cause (like in JDK 1.4).
  Introduced StackFrame interface for serializable backtrace information.
- Removed all deprecated TMC1 macros.
- CfgScript: getClass/GetClass also works with basic types.
- Fixed various performance bottlenecks in the CfgScript
  interpreter. Performance improved for a factor of 3 - 30.
- acdk_core: support for -logcat [category] and -logto [logtype or file] for all
  acdk applications (see %ref[acdk_util_logging]);
- acdk::util::Properties: add PropertiesChangeListener to listen on changes
	on Properties.
- CfgScript: not only allow to cast any to type, but also type to any.
  This has the result that functions with DmiObject parameter accepts
  any parameter.
- acdk::io::FileSystem revised. FileSystem plugins are now configured
	in the the properties (acdk.cfg by default). Opening files with file://, 
	http://, ftp://, .zip@ and .tar@	files will automatically load the 
	the corresponding FileSystem plugins.
- CfgScript/DMI: Provide new ScriptGlobals functions, like inOf, outOf,
  byRef, byVal, etc. (preparation for acdkx_rdmi).
- CfgScript: support unix hashbang (#!) lines.
- CfgScript: Implement JSP like %ref[templates for CfgScript, acdk_cfgscript_templates].
- String::equals() use cached hashCode to improve performance.
- Arrays: add methods to use array as stack, like pushFront,
  popBack.
- ObjectArrays: add methods to convert to and from ArrayList directly
- ClassLoader: support for library aliases defined in the 
  propertyfile acdk.lang.ClassLoaderAliase 
  (cfg/acdk/lang/ClassLoaderAliase.properties).
- CfgScript: foreach is allowed also for String or StringBuffer
  (foreach (char c in StringOrStringBuffer) {})
- acdkmc: Parsing header with "class UPPER_CASE_MACROS MyClass"
  fixed. The macro is not limited to ACDK_ or ACDKX_ macros.
- Object finalization: lock memory if this will be referenced
  inside finalize or destructor.
- using the THROWx-Statements a throwable can be intercepted
  after constructed, but before throws using the 
  %cref[acdk::lang::ThrowListener] interface.
- CfgScript: create a DmiDelegate object from a short Script
  string.
- CfgScript: enhanced Props class. clone() is supported. 
  A Props can itself render as CfgScript code.
- acdk::lang::Number (and other, like Integer): Support of
	non latin unicode digits in parsing.
	Locale support parsing, stringifing float, double values.
	Extended support for parsing with leading whitespaces or
	trailing characters.
- acdk::lang::Number: fixed parsing literal 0xFFFF (previous
  the last F was interpreted as type hint.
- acdk::util::Properties: fixed loading properties files with
  backslash at the end of the line.
- MetaInfo: MetaInfo can now be unloaded (needed for CfgScript
  debugger).
- CfgScript: support %ref[backtick expressions, acdk_cfgscript_hb_lang_expr_backtick]
  like <c>s = `"j + 1 is ${i + 1}"`;</c> and transparent invocation
  of external programs.
- acdk::util: Some classes where ports from the GNU Classpath
  (back in 1999). Added corresponding license notes.
- Complete ACDK: Removed the QPL license. ACDK is distributed
  only with LGPL license from now.
- CfgScript: Implemented a %ref[command line debugger, acdk_cfgscript_hb_debug]. 
  Start acdkcfgscript with -csfdebug option.
- CfgScript: Fixed some bugs in inheritance casting and 
  invoking.
- CfgScript: add build in support for %ref[ACDK_LOG() and ACDK_NLOG(), acdk_cfgscript_hb_lang_logging].
- CfgScript: add support for %ref[interfaces, acdk_cfgscript_hb_lang_class_decl#Interface] declared in CfgScript.

===========================================================
acdk_core 2.01.3
- acdk::lang::System::getEnvironment returns the
  original environment
- Fixed Bugs in acdk::lang::Process.
- Initial version of templated version of the collection
  framework. Unfortunatelly gcc 2.92.* crashes (gcc 3.* works
  fine). The performance improvements of the templated version
  and the Object based version is about 20 - 30 %.

===========================================================
acdk_core 2.01.2

- Fixed bug in ObjectArrayImpl::equals in case of Nil.
- Implemented clone() for the standard value Objects String,
  StringBuffer, Boolean, Character, Byte, Integer, etc.
- Fixed wrong exported template, which results in a linker
  problem with VC7.
- Borland C++ doesn't like method throw declaration like 
  'void foo() throw RThrowable, RException'. It results
  in strange error message "Unresolved external __tpdsc__ ...".
  The THORWSx expands now to empty strings for borland compiler.
- Other Borland C++ compatibility fixed.
  
  
===========================================================
acdk_core 2.01.1

- Introduces class attribute ACDK_WITH_DMIPROXY for interfaces
  which direct the meta compiler to generate a DMI'able Proxy.
  This enables to use scripting and distribution languages to
  implement an ACDK Interface.
- In the AbstractObjectRader/Writer the flag SerializeJoinedStrings 
  will manage the Strings written in a dictonary. Equal Strings 
  will only written once into the stream. This has following 
  advantages: If the content written to stream contains many 
  equal strings (like XML or source code) the size of the stream 
  is much smaller. Deserialized into an Object the complete 
  structure in RAM is much smaller, because all equal Strings 
  shares one instance of the String. 
- fixed bug in acdk::lang::Process implementation for Windows.
  Detached processes can not catch in, err and out.
- new method acdk::io::Reader::readIntoString()
- implemented acdk::io::File::createTempFile()
- acdk::io::CharArrayWriter::toString() bug fixed.
- removed outdated acdk::lang::Logger interface.
- Fixed little bug in ClassLoader in case of VisualStudio + 
  release target.

===========================================================
acdk_core 2.00.1

- introduced acdk::lang::sys::core_atomicop 
  for synchronisation of refcounting.
  
- introduced acdk::lang::sys::BackTrace as
  replacement for the trace macros. 
  If ACDK is compiled with debugging info,
  Backtrace can print call stack (will be used
  in Throwable.
  
- introduced Marshaler interfaces for 
  extended DMI interface. 
  BYVALIN, BYVALOUT, BYVALINOUT can
  be used to tag arguments for automatic
  marshal the Objects in to a stream with
  the ObjectWriter interface.

- introduced a acdk/io/AbstractObjectReader/Writer
  which should be used base class for compatible
  Object serialization.
  The acdk/io/BinaryObjectReader/Writer is ajusted.
  the acdk/xml/XMLObjectReader/Writer is ajusted.
  
- introduced RefHolderExt.h for passing a 
  RObject itself as reference argument. 
  The IN, OUT, and INOUT-Macros can be 
  used for this.
  
- Introduced SBSTR() in acdk/lang/StringBuffer.h 
  to stream values into a string. Usefull for
  expection arguments.

- Changed all Writer/Reader interfaces to 
  byte*/byteArray. 
  Fixed some related bugs.
 
- acdmc splits large clazzinfo files into chunks
  of ~ 1/2 MB, to avoid that compiler (especially 
  with optimation settings) run out of space.

- acdkmc contains a first draft for a ACDK2IDL
  which generates from a given ACDK interface 
  corresponding CORBA IDL definitions.
  
- intoduced new tags for metainfo:
  ACDK_WITH_METAINFO generate all information, including
  script interface.
  ACDK_WITH_MI_MEMBER generates all information about
  members, but none about functions.
  ACDK_WITH_MI_GCINFO generates only information, which
  may be needed for garbage collection.
  The metacompiler acdkmc will generate the corresponding
  functions.
  
- acdkmc do generate function information only for 
  public functions.
  
- acdkmc recognise enum as valid type. It will be mapped
  to an int.
  
- New: Class ::acdk::lang::CmdLineParser* for parsing
  command lines.

- Changed Casting from RObject's to Interfaces a little 
  bit. Some automatic casts from an RSomeClass to 
  RSomeInterface does not work longer, and you have
  to cast explicite with:
  RSomeInterface si = (RSomeInterface)obj;

Please refer also to %ref[../ChangeLog].
