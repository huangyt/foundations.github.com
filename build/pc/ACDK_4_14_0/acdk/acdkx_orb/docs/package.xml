ACDKX ORB (acdkx_orb)
</title>

<shortdescription>
ACDKX ORB provides a lean/fast/easy to use CORBA ORB for ACDK.
</shortdescription>
<description>
<m>acdkx_orb</m> implements a CORBA ORB for ACDK Objects.

It is designed to fit into the ACDK DMI concept, which
means that each CORBA object can be controled by any 
ACDK DMI Client (ACDK C++, CfgScript, COM, Perl, Lisp, Python, 
Tcl, Java) and each ACDK Server (ACDK C++, CfgScript, COM, Lisp, Java)
can provide its interfaces as CORBA components.  

Different to official C++ language binding, the %ref[ACDK binding, acdkx_orb_mapping]
is much more simple. 

<m>acdkx_orb</m> provides a %ref[acdkmc, acdkmc_man] plugin to generated %ref[static skeletons, acdkx_orb_static_skel]
directly from source (not IDL). For usage with other orbs the %ref[<m>acdkxorbidl</m>, acdkxorbidl_man] can be used
to generade IDL definitions from ACDK C++ headers.

An experimental %ref[dynamic binding, acdkx_orb_dynamic_proxy] can be used to comunikate via IIOP without any
static skeleton.
